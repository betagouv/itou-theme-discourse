# Theme ITOU Discourse

> Th√®me pour le [forum des acteurs de l'inclusion](forum.inclusion.beta.gouv.fr/).

### Built With

 - Sass
 - [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse)
 - [discourse_theme](https://github.com/discourse/discourse_theme)

## Getting Started

This is a discourse theme, you'll want to check the [official documentation](https://meta.discourse.org/t/developer-s-guide-to-discourse-themes/93648).

To get a local copy up and running or to use this in production, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

 - You need to have a discourse forum where you are admin in order to add this theme.
 - It's best to have the `[discourse_theme](https://github.com/discourse/discourse_theme)` gem installed on your local machine in order to ensure a smooth development experience. This tool watches for changes in your local repository and updates the theme in consequence.

### Local development:

 - On your forum (say it's running on `http://localhost:3000`)
   - if it's [itou-discourse](https://github.com/betagouv/itou-discourse), run it with `make run`
   - create a [new API key](http://localhost:3000/admin/api/keys/new). It should be a **User API key**, NOT a global API key.
 - clone this project on your machine (say you clone it in /home/itou/theme-itou-discourse)
 - configure [`discourse_theme`](https://github.com/discourse/discourse_theme), by providing:
    - your forum URL
    - your API key
 - run `discourse_theme watch /home/itou/theme-itou-discourse`

Now, every change made to the theme will be updated on the forum.
If changes are not picked up, you may need to ensure the right theme is being used.

### Production

 - Import the theme in the admin panel (in `admin/customize/themes`) by providing this Git repository
 - More info in the [official documentation](https://meta.discourse.org/t/developer-s-guide-to-discourse-themes/93648)
